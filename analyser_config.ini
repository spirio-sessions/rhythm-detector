SampleRate = 44100 # samples per second - in the original signal
ChunkLength = 5.0 # seconds - length of a subsequent segment of the signal that are processed at a time
WindowLength = 0.25 # seconds - length of the context window that is used for preprocessing, i.e. smoothing the signal
HopLength = 0.05 # seconds - size of the window offset between preprocessing applications - effectively the max resolution of the signal after preprocessing
DominantWindowLength = 0.5 # seconds - length of the context window used for interpolating the window's base dominant threshold
DominantHopLength = 0.25 # seconds - size of the window offest between dominant threshold calculations - no further downsampling does apply thus keeping the preprocessing resolution
DominantScale = 1.0 # factor by which a dominant amplitude must exceed the dominant window's base dominant threshold
